1. This program is created by using threads.
2. Since we have threads, we break the list into parts, feed the parts to separate threads that do the sorting.
3. Threads use the same address space. This means that the data must be passed to a function.
4. The main function will compute the final sorted list by combining all of the sorted sublists. This needs to be done in O(N) linear time.
5. The sorting function from my threads could be either insertion sort or bubble sort.
6. --> First wrote the program that reads the list of numbers and sorts them. So that you know the program is reading the list correctly and your sort is functioning properly.
   --> Try to add in the code for 2 threads.
